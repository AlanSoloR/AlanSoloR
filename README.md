**PROJECTS**

* **[Analysis of crimes in Mexico](https://github.com/AlanSoloR/Portfolio/blob/main/DataExplorationAndVisual.ipynb)**

In this project I analyzed the crimes committed in Mexico between 2015-2023 to detect behaviors and possible trends of different crimes by year, month and the number of crimes by state.

I used Python to perform this analysis with the help of tools such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.
